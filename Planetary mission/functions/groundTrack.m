% 
% Function to obtain groundtrack variables from cartesian coordinates
%
% INPUT:
%   state = position and velocity matrix [?x6]
%   theta_G0 = Initial Greenwich Meridian Longitude [1x1]
%   t = time vector from ODE [?x1] [s]
%   w_E = Earth angular velocity [1x1] [rad/s]
%   t_0 = initial value of time [1x1] [s]
%
% OUTPUT:
%   alpha =  right ascension [?x1] [deg]
%   delta =  declination [?x1] [deg]
%   longitude =  [?x1] [deg]
%   latitude = [?x1] [deg]
