%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Function that creates a matrix of orbital parameters from a file
%       
% INPUT:
%   filename: variable of type char, it's the name of the file
%   containing the orbital parameters
%                                                                         
% OUTPUT:
%   kep:matrix containing the orbital parameters extracted from the file,
%   with the following order: 
%   [major semi-axis; eccentricity; inclination; RAAN; pericenter's anomaly; true anomaly]
%
